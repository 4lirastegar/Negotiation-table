## Research Question

**Do LLM agents adapt strategically during negotiation, or do they primarily imitate learned conversational patterns?**

---

## Overview

Negotiation Arena is a research framework where autonomous LLM agents negotiate under different personas and conflicting goals.

The project investigates how agent personality influences:

- agreement
- persuasion
- cooperation
- utility
- semantic coherence

using automated evaluation pipelines.

## Features

- 🤖 Autonomous GPT-4o negotiation agents
- 🎭 Configurable personas
- 📊 Automatic evaluation pipeline
- 🧠 Persuasion analysis
- 😊 Emotion analysis
- 📈 Utility calculation
- 📚 Semantic coherence analysis

## Experiment

| Configuration | Value |
|--------------|------:|
| Agents | 2 |
| Personas | 6 |
| Negotiations | 60 |
| Scenario | Used-car sale |

---

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Agreement Rate | 80–100% |
| Avg. Coherence | 0.72–0.76 |
| Price Convergence | 99.84% |

The results suggest persona-dependent adaptive behavior, although they do not establish genuine reasoning.
